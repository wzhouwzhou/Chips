<strong id="guide_title">Olevirith's Guide to Manager</strong> 
</head>
 
<br>
Manager is similar to the Overlord, but be more conservative when attacking, don't rush the opponent. 
Play more like a Necromancer, claw to maximize drones instead of directly attacking opponents.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>1. Builds</strong>
	<br>
I use the build of 0/0/2/7/7/6/4/7 for a few reasons. Regen isn't too important if you can hide well, 
and dodge. Max health is just dodging and dodging accuracy, so i dont inlude any, so I know exactly where I'm 
dodging to. The 2 body damage is to more tank a hit, than add to health, so i have durability. Durability combined with 
precision dodging is what I like to use. Then I use 7 bullet speed and 7 bullet penetration because of (drones). 

But with this particular manager build changes at the bullet damage. I use 6 bullet damage because it eliminates drones a 
small bit faster on contact with other things. The 7 pen is to last, and 6 damage doesnt make too much of a difference off 
of 7 because of Manager's coding buffs. So I attack with similar damage, and use the faster elimination as an advantage with 
the 4 reload. So i can manipulate the drones in the arena as a mix, and use it in many unique strats, because of all the possible 
utilizations of fast, consistent reload, as well as 7 movement speed. (which is almost standard on drone classes.) The 2 body 
damage is extremely useful for tanking a few hits, but without sacrificing much for that power.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>2. Strategies</strong>
	<br>
My strategy utilizes the 6 bullet damage and the 4 reload to make a consistent stream of new refreshing drones. 
Basically, I utilize the reload to create a drone swarm, (which is spread out) to confuse and misdirect the target 
while hiding myself. When the enemy makes a mistake, I take the fastest opportunity to attack and kill. 
Now, let me explain how I execute it, and how it is extremely effective.
	<br>
	<br>
The start is to spread out the drones, but this, however simple it seems, is the hardest and most crucial step. 
I place my mouse cursor behind the drones, but repelling them a bit wider than usual. I then turn them (to put it simply) 
and send them out in an arrow formation towards a possible location of the target. (I'm going to refer as the target as an overlord) 
	<br>
	<br>
Next step I can do 2 things, but lets walk through each one.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>I can:</strong>
	<br>
	<br>
1:
	<br>
Follow the drones and charge into a [most likely] ready target. The reason I dont choose this choice often is because it 
is putting your own tank closer to the enemy drones/tank with your own drones in an unprepared repel position built to 
prepare for a standard claw. This is risky and possible in only a few situations, which are:
	<br>
	<br>
a: The target is unprepared. 
	<br>
	<br>
b: I use the formation to form a pierce.
	<br>
	<br>
2:
	<br>	
Dodge to the side of my repel, and approach slower, while sending my drones further out into a repel to cover a large[r] area. 
I then stop and hide to wait for the target. When I spot the target, I let a drone of mine die, and that starts the fight 
(because of my reload.) I immediately spring into action and start to flee into a dodge; Then I attempt a claw. 
(sometimes works, sometimes doesnt.) I retreat and twist my drones into a kind of "Whirlpool" which keeps the drones in a 
constant motion. I try to use the reload for a constant stream to hide my location and when I spot the target, (in a prediction) I
kill, and retract the full circle into a standard defense. 
	<br>
	<br>
For defense, while most drones are away, its wise to keep a few of the newer regenerated drones close to your tank to protect 
against surprise attacks. We can do this by controlling our repel, and I can get into that later. Controlling the repel is a 
foundational technique to learn and best if it is utilized for the methods I make for drone classes. Back to Manager; the 4 reload 
is your main offense and only defense, if you cant destroy your own drones in a moment of danger, you die, so find your 
opponent's drones/bullets and pierce your own into them, that will regenerate your own drones while you retreat for a defense. 
4 reload is perfectly timed for these kind of situations.
