<strong id="guide_title">Sushikuu7 and TechnicalG87's Guide to Landmine</strong> 
</head>
 
<br>
Landmine is one of the most looked down upon tanks, especially with its 15 second invisibility and slow speed. However, 
this tank is extremely powerful when used right, and can become a formidable force on the battlefield.
	<br>
	<br>
    <strong>1. Tactics</strong>
	<br>
	Landmine is one of those classes that seem like they don't need any tactics to get kills, and are simple tanks that anyone
	can use to get high scores. However, to get those high scores, you need to learn how to use the variety of tactics
	that the Landmine carries with it.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>1: Dropping</strong>
	<br>
When dealing with  bullet spammers, there's a perfect technique for that. I've used it many times to get high scores with Landmine.
"Dropping" is essentially what its name represents, but you drop yourself. This is especially effective on pentas, 
spreads, and other bullet spammers with recoil.

To put it simply, to perform a drop, you must do these three things first:
    <br>
    <br>
a: Taunt them. Get close to them with an attempt to kill, but try to take as little damage as possible by dodging.
    <br>
    <br>
b: Get them to chase you. The problem a lot of the time is that people lose interest in you quickly. 
Aggravating them by taunting is necessary in this step if they lost interest in you.
    <br>
    <br>
c: Once they are chasing you, they will probably be using their recoil to chase you. Keep them just outside of your FoV, 
and make sure you are travelling vertically.
    <br>
    <br>
d: Make sure you see them chasing you one last time, and exit their FoV. Remember, you have a higher FoV than they do. 
If you can't see them, they definitely can't see you.
    <br>
    <br>
e: Abruptly reverse direction and rush them as they go backwards. Most players will get into a habit of relaxing after 
about 10 seconds of chasing you, and this will usually kill them. Very rarely do people have good reflexes and turn around in time. 
If they do turn around, run. You cannot win. 
    <br>
    <br>
f: If this fails the first time, try again. 90% of players are dumb and will fall for the same trick twice. 
If that player is more intelligent though, find a distraction and get them killed/kill them while they're distracted.
    <br>
    <br>
g: A good way to use a distraction is to have them fight it, and when they back up, rush from above or beneath them 
vertically and ram them to death. They will be too busy focusing on the other enemy to notice you immediately.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>2: Brute Forcing</strong>
	<br>
A very risky technique, and works well against low health targets with low reload. If they're about to die, 
but you just can't reach them and have at least 30% of your health, just push through and eventually you'll hit them and kill them.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>3. Tap and Run</strong>
	<br>
This works perfectly against other smashers, especially if you use a high regen build. Essentially, you need to come 
in contact with them, and the instant you take damage, turn around. They will chase you, and at least 1-5 seconds later, 
you will have more health than them, and colliding with them will kill them. This only works if you have more regen than 
them however, as you must have more health than them to kill them. If they regenerate more health than you, you will die.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>4. Direct Collision</strong>
	<br>
The opposite of Tap and Run, as instead of you having more regen, you have less regen. When you two come into a fight, 
don't let them tap and run. Just collide with them where both of you are heading at each other, and you will win. Because of 
how they cannot regenerate to get more health than you in the split second you two collide, the one with more health will usually 
win. Most players trade off max health or body damage for regen, and if you use the standard 3/10/10/10 build, you will win. 
    <br>
    <br>
If they do tap and run, don't let them touch you again. Run as far away as you can until you fully regen. 
Only then should you try again.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>2. Builds</strong>
	<br>
Builds are essential to any smasher. They determine the outcome of a fight, and always have 10 movement speed, 
as smashers are already very slow. The best builds include:
    <br>
    <br>
1: Standard Smasher Build: 
3/10/10/10
	<br>
Just the standard, maximum strength an speed, low regen.
    <br>
    <br>
2: Skilled Smasher Build: 
4/9/10/10
	<br>
Why trade one max health for regen? 4 is the magic number for stats. 4 bullet speed is the middle ground between slow bullets and fast bullets. 4 regen will get you enough regen to regen quickly, but you won't lose much power this way. This build also works very well with Tap and Run.
    <br>
    <br>
3: Trolling in Sandbox Build: 
10/10/10/3
	<br>
We all know this one. Best for trolling against other Smashers.
    <br>
    <br>
<strong>3. Leveling</strong>
    <br>
Landmine is a really easy tank to acquire, if you level properly. In any given match, by level 24 you should be 
able to kill a level 45 tank. 
    <br>
    <br>
There are 2 ways to do this:
    <br>
a. My way (recommended) (3/7/7/0/0/0/0/7)
    <br>
By level 15 you should have a 3/3/5/0/0/0/0/4 build.
    <br>
By level 20 you should have a 3/3/7/0/0/0/0/7 or a 3/6/7/0/0/0/0/4 build.
    <br>
At level 24 you should have a 3/7/7/0/0/0/0/7 build
    <br>
    <br>
--OR--
    <br>
    <br>
b. Bullet Build (normally high penetration and damage)
Pretty much a standard bullet build.
Not recommended ;-;
