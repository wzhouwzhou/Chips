<strong id="guide_title">Flameyman, Hunji, and PEKMEN's Guide to Auto Trapper</strong>
</head>
 
<br>
Auto-Trapper is a very diverse class, as it can be used for defense as well as strong attack. 
You may think that you need high bullet Speed for the class to be useful, but that isn't the case. 
Useful builds include 0/0/0/5/7/7/7/7 if you like glass cannons or you could also use the build 2/1/2/3/7/7/6/5. 
Now you may think that this build is surprising because of the low bullet Speed but in fact it's not. 
The Auto Gun is your main attack form and the Auto Gun shoots much faster than the bullet Speed suggests so 
it would be about the equivalent of 4-5 bullet Speed. The low bullet Speed also helps with defense as the trap 
lays closer to you making more of a congested lump around you. Obviously you have to focus on dodging and trap laying 
as the Auto Gun is not controllable.
<br>
<br>
<strong>1. Counters</strong>
<br>
The Destroyer branch tanks generally don't pose as much of a threat as you'd think, especially considering the builds listed in Part 3.
Most drone classes can't do much if you've laid out an irregular trap field: Overlord/Overseer and Manager can break through a few of your traps,
but so long as you have enough traps to retreat into, you can focus on attacking the drone user, as they are now exposed to your auto turret. 
Battleship, however, can be annoying or even quite dangerous. It doesn't need to destroy your traps - its little drones usually just slide past them. 
If you're working with a more tanky build, this might not be as much of a problem, though it can still be your death eventually. 
Bullet spammers vary, though you could roughly separate them along 2 lines: high versus low bullet speed and large versus small bullets. 
<br>
<br>
Spreadshot and Sprayer actually fall in between as their bullets are not of the same size.
Bullet spammers with large bullets are usually quite powerful. While Triplets and Twins can quite efficiently destroy your traps, 
they are usually vulnerable to your turret at higher bullet speeds. Their bullets do form a solid wall at lower speeds, though. 
<br>
<br>
Pentashot and Octotank could be dangerous... though especially Pentashot will often take several hits from your turret and retreat. 
Streamliner and Auto Gunner fall under small bullets. They have a better chance at hitting you as their bullets 
have a smaller hitbox. While Streamliners can easily push your traps away, the tank's body itself is quite vulnerable. 
Use strafing to your advantage. Auto Gunner doesn't push traps as much, but its bullets are smaller. I'm not quite sure what to think. 
I've mained Auto Gunner and an Auto Trapper's turret is surprisingly strong against it, especially when paired with good trap placement.
<br>
<br>
Factory is the best counter to Auto Trapper. However, Battleship ranks second and is actually harder to 
protect yourself from, while Factory is basically immune to your turret.
<br>
<br>
<strong>2. Playstyle</strong>
<br>
Now, to be able to effectively play Auto Trapper, you need to know everything about its Auto Gun, because without it, it's just a normal Trapper. 
The Auto Gun is just like any normal one, it will lock on to one target (shape or player) at a time, and will not stop shooting at it unless you go 
outside it's shooting range or until the target is destroyed. Basically, that same Auto Gun is your way of fighting tanks as well. 
<br>
<br>
You shoot traps to defend yourself and dodge bullets, and you let the Auto Gun shoot the enemy down. However it mostly works against slower enemies. 
Don't even bother against faster enemies unless you've got 7 movement speed, in which case you'll 
need to be careful, because the build will most likely be glass.
