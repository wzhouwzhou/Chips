<strong id="guide_title">Face The Music/Faceplant911's Guide to Gunner Trapper</strong>
</head>
 
<br>
The gunner-trapper is the most powerful combination boost class in the game, because it is the one and only 
combination class which really exceeds the sum of its parts. It has two major parts, the gunner side consisting 
of two small guns, and the trapper side which has a single slightly large trapper launcher.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>1. Weapons</strong>
	<br>
In most combination classes, the combo parts are slightly nerfed over their originals, such as hybrid 
drones being unaimable, manager invisibility being simple to see through, auto-gunner having only one auto 
gun which is also not dependable, and factory being very difficult to control. Gunner-trapper, while it appears 
to have the same kinds of nerfs with its reduced trap firing rate and only two small guns, is actually much more 
useful than it looks, and often the individual devices are even more effective than the originals that the fusion was based on.
	<br>
	<br>
For example, your average player would look at gunner-trapper's guns and say, what the heck, gunner was weak 
with 4 guns, so the 2 guns must be useless! Also, they might look at the large trap maker, and say, who cares? 
Its just a low reload basic trapper with weak guns and less effective defenses that you can't even aim well because 
the trap fires away from the cursor. And that is just the first layer of how wrong your average player would be.
In fact, the gunner-trapper is superior over the gunner in almost every way excluding the width of its firing stream. 
Its guns have penetration similar to spreadshot guns, which are constant targets of "nerf this" complaints. 
Its recoil is increased, allowing it to effectively run from enemies which overpower it and bad situations where 
it might be surrounded. It even has the viewing range of the trapper, alowing it to effectively fight over a greater 
distance than gunners can. The only reason gunner-trapper could possibly not be an improvement over gunner would be if 
your aim is horrible which if you are on diepio lab I assume your aim is not.
	<br>
	<br>
Next up comes the trapper launcher. This thing is extremely useful for several reasons. Unlike your average trapper, 
which can fill the terrain with traps and create a wall, gunner-trapper has what amounts to a pressure gun, which is easy 
to aim. As long as you are moving away from the enemy, you are putting pressure between you and your enemy, forcing them to 
be less able to dodge your gun (which matters because of the small bullet stream) and also restricts their retreat when 
they are damaged. The launcher also has traps which are the closest in size to triangles, and when playing ffa/maze, 
your traps appear almost like red triangles to the enemy, who if they aren't careful, will walk directly into the trap 
when they assume the triangle trap isn't deadly. (also works on red team in team games)
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>2. Builds</strong>
	<br>
For the builds, gunner trapper works well with most combinations of x/x/x/4/7/7/5/x, where you have about 10 points 
to distribute how you feel like. It can be a glass build, a slow but tanky build, it even has the recoil to pull of a 
rammer if you are creative. However, the most effective builds for gunner trapper tend to actually be these two:
	<br>
	<br>
The Bunker Gunner: 1/2/2/7/7/7/7/0
	<br>
The Slayer: 0/0/0/7/7/6/7/6
	<br>
The Bunker Gunner is a better build for elongated fighting and 1v1 specialists. It has a good amount of health, 
plenty of traps to fire from behind, and the low speed is a perfect compliment because it means the Bunker Gunner 
tends to create a safety wall behind it, which it can retreat behind using recoil very quickly.
	<br>
	<br>
Using the full power 7777 bullets, the Bunker Gunner can hit any target except for a destroyer simply by 
outpenetrating it, and a little bit of movement and shaking can easily get around destroyer bullets. 
Therefore, this is the ultimate team support build for gunner-trapper because it will force any one enemy to 
retreat or die, which is something not many other classes can do. It can also hold its own in FFA, using its clump of 
traps to survive for extended periods of time without needing to depend on defensive penetration to save itself in most cases.
	<br>
	<br>
Another option for support and tricking the enemy is spam left clicking, which allows the placement of traps 
without much or any firing of the gun. When used at the right time, it allows you to create a trap wall without 
alerting the enemy to your position as you make it.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>3. Strategies</strong>
	<br>
Now for the main event in my opinion, the specialized Slayer.
This build is the quite possibly the ultimate death weapon in the game, with the power to fight pentashots, 
overlords, top tier factories, and fighters, all in one single build. With most glass cannon tanks, it is not 
advisable to reduce damage because, as experiments have shown, reload has the least effect on the total power of 
bullets and therefore many people would argue that 00077766 is better, or that more power is simply necessary and 
that 00077775 is the best glass build. However, for my particular fighting style, neither of these is the case.
	<br>
	<br>
Unlike many other tanks, the Slayer is designed not to directly fight an enemy's bullet stream, but to ghost through it 
and strike the tank itself with weakened bullets. In order for the bullets to strike the enemy with as much possible power as 
can be achieved, the order of importance for stats is:
	<br>
	<br>
1: Bullet Speed, because ghosting is simply a word for moving through the enemy bullet without cancelling out, and the faster 
the bullet is, the more likely the bullets will pass without killing each other and therefore ruining the ghosting.
	<br>
2: Bullet Penetration, because when ghosting, while you are not trying to kill the enemy bullet with your own bullet damage, 
you are trying to survive the enemy bullet in order to actually deal a blow.
	<br>
3: Reload, because the more bullets you fire that stand a chance of hitting, the more damage you will do total.
	<br>
4: Finally, Bullet Damage, because you do need to deal actual damage that matters to the enemy, but that only matters after the 
first 3 steps of actually reaching the target are covered.
	<br>
	<br>
Now, many people might be looking at this and wondering, why can't I just do 00077775, it has the full power of 
ghosting and still has 5 speed, which is plenty fast enough. If this is what you are thinking, I totally understand. 
That is why I have a little more to tell you. The fact of the matter is, speed is an incredibly efficient stat with 
gunner-trapper for several reasons, and having 6 instead of 5 makes the difference  in a lot of situations.
It is efficient because first off, the more speed, the more likely a glass cannon will survive in a bad situation. 
With 5 speed, getting surrounded is much more likely to be deadly than with 6 speed. Also, 6 speed+firepower+recoil 
is almost always enough to escape an Overlord even if they attack head on to stop you from hitting them with guns as they attack.
Also, because of the other important trait of the gunner-trapper, the "pressure gun" as I called it earlier.
	<br>
	<br>
Basically, by moving away from the general direction of an enemy while leaving traps in the way, you are effectively 
shooting traps towards them. If you are able to move away from one enemy while firing at a different enemy, you can create
one of the only aimable double direction attacks in the game, firing in two directions at once.
However, using this technique means that your movement away from the target you are aiming traps at will not be 
supported by recoil unless you are aiming both your weapons simultaneously at that enemy by moving away from them while firing.
	<br>
	<br>
Because of that, having 6 movement speed rather than 5 significantly increases the effect of the trap's pressure gun by 
allowing you to use it effectively for a longer time before an enemy gets too close, without needing to depend on recoil to 
bring you to the necessary speed to fight the enemy you are moving away from.
	<br>
	<br>
The next advice is also fairly important, the final bonus between gunner trapper and gunner.
When playing as a gunner, truly syncing the bullets is nearly impossible. The reload can be screwed with, 
but getting all the shots together is way to difficult to be useable in competitve play. However, with gunner-trapper, 
it is actually very easy to synchronize the bullets, just press fire once then quickly hold fire after that. 
	<br>
	<br>
With a few tries, it is pretty easy to get used to starting synchronization on the fly. When synched, the bullets fire 
together, and when both bullets hit the power is very high and can deal significant damage to an enemy. Also, the knockback 
is enough to slow/stop a moving object in general, and can allow you to, for example, push an enemy into a trap you previously 
lay using a synced shot. Another thing, is that synced shots work fairly well vs enemies such as pentashot and octotank, 
where the double hit is much more powerful than a single hit and also more likely to penetrate the enemy defensive fire as a group.
