<strong id="guide_title">Olevirith's Guide to Auto Gunner</strong> 
</head>
 
<br>
So i shall be the one for this channel, i believe. I specialize in Auto Gunner, and I can certainly convince almost anyone 
that it is a phenomenal tank. Looking forward to it :)
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>1. Builds</strong>
	<br>
Let's take a look at a base build of 3/0/2/3/7/6/7/5.
Dissecting the build, we see a 3/0/2 in health which the 2 body damage can help you tank several hits, 
very crucial to surviving in FFA and Maze. Bullet stats of 3/7/6/7 is ideal for bullet output + pen. 6 bullet damage, 
some might ask, but it only takes away 0.25% of the maximum bullet damage and allows for a very slight increse in pen, 
as well as another free point to insert in another crucial spot in the build. 5 movement speed is pretty explanatory. But it 
works together with the 3 bullet speed to make a wall aspect, while still being able to achieve kills.
	<br>
	<br>
There is also a Minimum Speed build of 2/2/4/4/7/7/7/0.
This build allows for more health and bullet speed, but takes away from movement. 
The tank is built to last and be bulky. You cannot chase, but you can stalk, and also scare 
them away most of the time due to 4 bullet speed. 
	<br>
	<br>
When they are shooting, try to block off all there bullets but don't try to Kite, or even attack much. The main goal of 
the build is annoyance, and built to last. You can even try to shake your turrets back and forth occasionally to try 
hit them when they move. You can always attempt to force them on a wall so that when they move, you can attack directly 
at their location of movement.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>2. Strategies</strong>
	<br>
Some strategies include Kiting around the opponent with the 5 movement speed, and spreading your bullets similarly in a wave pattern 
where the opponent is heading. You can take out many triplets and sprayers with this manuever.
Another strat is to dart in (again with the 5 ms) and just assult, while using bullets as a shield. Very effective against Pentashot,
Octotank, and Spreadshot. Also there is the strat where you move back and forth to build up more of a bullet wall. This strat is only 
ideal for fighting Sprayers. When fighting Overlords and ramming tanks, you must aim for where the opponent is going while movng in a 
small circle dodging around the enemy tanks/drones. This strategy is very hard to adapt, and learn, and master, because of the 
multitasking and predictions being used.
	<br>
	<br>
There is another advanced strategy I use. I combine the auto gunner's rate of movement depending on the bullet speed 
of the build to slightly trap the opponent, then once that is executed, I pull back into an arcing dodge and shoot 
at the side of the opponent to increse damage given. The trick is, you have to do these movements very fast, and with small movement.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>How to Execute this Strategy</strong>
	<br>
1: You are fighting your opponent (Let's use a Triplet as an example), Your bullets in the other opponent's 
bullet stream can almost counter the (Triplet) and the goal is to angle your bullets to the side of them, 
purposely missing (but not by much) and repeat on the other side.
	<br>
	<br>
2: When you have that, if you have 3  bullet speed you will have about one second to execute a small arc 
manuever to bombard the side of the opponent pushing them into your last placed bullets.
	<br>
(Disclaimer, will not kill, but at best chunk their health down to half.)
	<br>
	<br>
Step 3, If you act fast, you can use the (again) recently placed bullets, and weave to the other side of the opponent 
(you will have maximum 2 seconds to do so) and repeat the process.
	<br>
	<br>
Step 4, During this strategy, you are kind of sealing them in a trap, because if they try to escape, they lose more health. 
Try to shorten the duration of the manuever each time you use it, shortening the duration of the fight.
	<br>
	<br>
Start the fight cautious, leave the fight deadly.
The faster you do it, the faster the tank dies. in the end, mastery is your goal so you can do all this with only slight movements.
<br>
(This strategy is built towards 3/0/2/3/7/6/7/5.)
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>3. Fighting Overlords</strong>
	<br>
I personally use the build 0/0/1/7/7/7/4/7 to fight overlords. It is fast, low reload (which means precision shots), 
and it can tank one hit. The main concept is to use stealth to suprise the opponent of your location, then bombard them 
with rarely missing bullets, then back away and hide. But fighting overlord always takes a ton of scary dodging. You must be 
specifically trained to dodge an overlord. (I could help). If the training isn't availiable to you, these are the basic guidelines.
	<br>
	<br>
1: Find an overlord.
	<br>
	<br>
2: Start approaching them and shooting from the right or left of their drones (while) targeting the body.
	<br>
	<br>
3: When they attack, dart away and hide, then come back at an unsuspecting angle. (7 ms and bs will really help)
	<br>
	<br>
4: Basically repeat until they die.
	<br>
	<br>
Dodging is key, as well as good aim.
