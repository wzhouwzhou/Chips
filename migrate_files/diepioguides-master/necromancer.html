<strong id="guide_title">Anokuu's Guide to Necromancer</strong> 
</head>
 
<br>
Hello, this is Anokuu, a diep.io player mainly uses Necromancer.
Necromancer is my favorite and main class in diepio because it is very interesting and hard to use while I appreciate challenges. 
To play a good Necromancer, it requires both micromanagement controls and macroscopic predictions. Most class of diepio are just to 
overwhelming your opponent with bullets, while Necromancer and Overlord are the exceptions.
	<br>
	<br>
If you choose quantity over quality, area-control over assassination, and dodging over tanking, congratulations Necromancer 
fits you. However Necromancer isn't an easy class, in fact it is the hardest class to use. Are you ready? Here I want to share my 
knowledge of Necromancer. Be aware that different player has different play style. People often regard Necromancer as a defensive 
class as how it's chips are so strong and so many. However I believe Offensive = Defensive. You won't need to dodge if the enemy 
is already dead.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>1. Basic controls</strong>
	<br>
Drone controlling classes has two ways to control their drones. One is to simply left click or auto fire ("E" key). 
One is to right click or "Shift" key. By using shift key the drones will go to the opposite direction of where your mouse 
is pointing at, I call it "repel". Necromancer requires much more repel than any other drone controlling classes. 
Because of hit boxes of chips, when 34 of them moving in same direction in attract mode, they will push each other away. 
This will cause them to have only 3 or 4 chips in front of the "swarm" while leaving the rest of them behind, greatly reduce 
the efficiency and losing the advantage of quantity. 
	<br>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbFEOl5biFA&feature=youtu.be">Moving with Attract Mode</a>
	<br>
	<br>
Necromancer appreciate repel mode much more. With the sheer quantity of the chips, they can form a pressing wall. 
Repel can be much more versatile than attract mode. There are two type of repel. One is "Close Repel" which means repel 
near the chips, and the other is "Far Repel" which means repel at the edge of screen or as far from chips as possible. 
Because the chips move opposite toward the mouse, the further the mouse and chips are, the small angle they will spread.
	<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/dEPlRo_k0Xs">Difference Between Close and Far Repel</a>
	<br>
	<br>
As you can see, Far repel is much more efficient that the chips are much closer. However it is not absolute and many verity of 
it can be used. Now we advance to next level which are the use of Techniques. Movement Technique: Alternate between Attract and 
Repel. Use Repel most of the time and use Attract to control the size before it gets too spread out. 
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>2. Strategy</strong>
	<br>
Playing as Necromancer needs to have a sense of stockpile. Your chips are your health because you can't shoot. 
When your chips have run out you will be defenseless. So, when playing as Necromancer you have to stay away from "Desert" 
(places with no squares to farm, for example the center of the map with pentagons). Because Necromancer's square is basically 
it's health, there is no need to add point into health nor regeneration.
	<br>
	<br>
With the update on June 17th, the Necromancer's chip capacity is based on reload. The chip's count start from 18 chips with 
no reload, to 32 with max reload. Chips = 18 + (reload * 2). "reload", the drone count has become necessary for Necromancer.
More Chips = "More Health", Farming squares = "Regen" I put 6 or 7 on reload (drone count). 0 on max health, 0 on regen.
As Necromancer needs to farm, it needs speed. Without speed you will be a sitting duck when your chips have run out 
(which, in rare situation the bullet spam classes have cleaned the field). Diep.io has a system control total number of 
squares on the map. When a place's squares have run out, they often re-spawn on the other places of the map. Check out the 
minimap on bottom right and move to the places you haven't been to. With more speed you will be able to dodge bullets more 
easily, which will be required when you use certain techniques.
	<br>
	<br>
More Speed = Faster "Regen" I put 6 or 7 speed.
When you see an "oasis" (places where a lot of squares spawn) while your squares are maxed (You can check the count of your squares when you are not gaining any new squares when you kill a square) You can consider not to farm this place instantly, but save it for emergency refill of squares (health) instead. Necromancer is also best suited to fight in the place where the Chips can push the enemy into our "oasis" (Their desert) . Our chips refill as we chase down while they are being hit by the squares.
	<br>

	<strong>mancer build: 0/0/0/7/7/7/6/6</strong>
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>3. Techniques</strong>
	<br>
"Freeze" Rapidly press shift or right click (About 4 times a second). Good for style + rare situations.
	<br>
	<br>
"Spinning Repel" a good area control move. Chips can be sent to massive area evenly, and can react to any attack almost 
instantly because the chips are everywhere instead of being in one place. Attract to kill any single way attacker almost instantly. 
	<br>
	<br>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKo3olPVchQ&feature=youtu.be">Spinning Repel+Freeze</a>
	<br>
	<br>
"The Claw" Best offensive move. Use Close Repel in the opposite direction while moving toward the chips to cut in half. 
Move further to turn into a Far Repel. Predict the two stacks of chips are around the flank of enemy, use Attract. 
It is the only way Necromancer can deal with Machine Gun, Triplets etc as it attacks on both side. Use with caution. 
This leaves you open, so you need to dodge any bullets.
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>
"The Wall" Stylish Farming move. Close Repel to spread out then spin repel on one side of the convex. 
Then attract on the other side to form the wall. Often can be paired with "The Claw" to form a less noticeable attack. 
	<br>
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>
"The Boobie Trap" Credit to Cuffin. this trick is used as both offensive and defensively to ditch any pursuer tailing you. 
to execute it: 
	<br>
	<br>
	1: Repel into two groups (front and back) 
	<br>
	<br>
	2: Scatter both groups 
	<br>
	<br>
	3: Attract the front group and go about on your way by using the movement technique (
	repel from the back, attract at the front) 
	<br>
	<br>
	4: If no enemy appears after, retrieve the back group with just attracting the front group, 
	use the stockpiled chips to attack. 
	<br>
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>
"The Jaw" (suggested by /u/Amatysten) 
	<br>
	<br>
	1:First you open a half circle by repelling at the side of a tight group. 
	<br>
	<br>
	2:Repel until squares exit FOV (or at the edge, most tanks have narrower FOV). 
	Now you have an open jaw with you in the middle as a bait. Freeze it by right-clicking quickly. 
	<br>
	<br>
	3: A stray spammer will notice you and begin following, thinking you've lost all of your soldiers... 
	right into the jaw. Make sure the open end is facing the enemy, so that he does not suspect anything. 
	<br>
	<br>
	4: When he's in, collapse the jaw. Squares will come from every direction, making it almost impossible to survive. 
	<br>
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>4. Checks/Counters</strong>
	<br>
Bullet damage booster / fighter (NOT body damage booster / fighter) are the nemesis of Necromancer. 
They have super high penetration on it's front cannon, and fighter, which is worse, has it's side cannon as strong as 
its front cannon. They have both bulk, speed and high damage. Each of their bullets can kill 2 chips and can eventually 
wear out all chips Necromancer has stockpiled. When you see a booster/fighter rushing to you and their bullets kills your chip, 
try to use freeze to leave the chips behind you while you run away. If they see you when you have no chips, pray.
	<br>
	<br>
Machine Gun's bullets are such high penetration that they can shoot down all chips in 3 seconds. 
However they can't chase you down instantly. To deal with them you need to use "The Claw" to attack from both side. 
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Dealing With Ramming Classes</strong>
	<br>
In my opinion Necromancer is the best class to counter ramming classes and classes that has only one side cannon.
One of the special technique can be used is to put chips right in front of you when you "run", when they are close to you, 
use repel to attack backward. This can often catch them off - guard because they actually takes time to turn or retreat.
	<br>
	<br>
Here are some of the practical battle videos. Many of the techniques are being used.
Always be careful of random bullets.
