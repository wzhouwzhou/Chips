<strong id="guide_title">PEKMEN's Guide to Fighter</strong>
</head>
 
<br>
Now I'll try my best explain to you how you use glass Fighter in 2 and 4-TDM. I'd love to explain how you use it in 
FFA too, but I simply lack the focus to use Fighter in FFA for long periods of time. If you want to git gud with glass Fighter, 
I suggest you read my tips and tricks for using glass Fighter. 
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>1. Build</strong>
	<br>
First, let's look at the build. Glass Fighters have many builds, such as 0/0/0/5/7/7/7/7, 
0/0/0/6/7/7/7/6, 0/0/0/7/7/7/7/5 etc. Basically, it's up to your preference, but I'll talk about the 
2 builds that I use, 0/0/0/7/7/6/7/6 and 0/0/0/7/7/7/7/5. 
	<br>
	<br>
Now I'll divide tanks into 7 categories and explain to you how you fight each and every one of them. 
You may not believe it, but a good Fighter is capable of fighting any tank in the game.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>2. Bullet Spammers</strong>
	<br>
Now these classes can be tricky to face in combat with Fighter, even killing them is not very easy, 
but it's far from impossible. First, MAKE SURE YOU DON'T FIRE AT THEIR BULLETS, YOU ONLY HAVE 1 POWERFUL 
TURRET WHILE THEY SPAM A LOT OF BULLETS. Instead, what you should do is fire at the tank itself from the 
sides where they are vulnerable while strafing and dodging any bullets that can hit you. If they try to run away, 
you have the speed to catch up to them, just don't charge carelessly like an MG Booster would. Basically, repeat 
this process and sooner or later, the bullet spammer will die.
	<br>
	<br>
Now for Pentashots/Spreadshots, they are probably the most tricky class to face as Fighter, but they aren't
capable of killing you unless you get too close, but of course you wouldn't do that if you had a brain. 
To fight them, first keep your distance from them and try shooting at their gaps between their bullets 
(optional: get closer if you want your hit to land, but not too close as they can hit back). Again you have 
the speed and power to do it, so just repeat it and they will die. For better chances at success, trap them 
into a place where they can't run.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>3. Rammers</strong>
	<br>
Fighter is easily the best choice to face these tanks as you've got the speed to chase even 
Boosters and Annihilators and the power to kill them easily. Rammers often underestimate Fighter and it's 
capabilities, so basically just charge at them, BUT DON'T GET TOO CLOSE OTHERWISE THEY COULD RAM YOU. Keep 
firing at them and they will gradually lose health, and keep chasing them and they are all yours. Note: While 
mastering Fighter, expect to die to rammers quite a bit, I died lots of times to them, but now that I've mastered 
Fighter they can't do anything to me.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>4. Drone Classes</strong>
	<br>
Now these classes (except Necro) are extremely hard to kill. Even I have problems killing Overlords nowadays, 
but I'll try my best to explain to you how this is done. First for Necro, just use Hit and Run tactics against 
it to wear it's drones out quickly and go in for the kill when they're out of drones. Now for Manager, it isn't 
nearly as hard to kill as Overlord, use the same tactics as for Necro, the drones' respawn rate can't keep up 
with you. Just remember that 2 drones from them and you're dead. 
	<br>
	<br>
Now for the most pain in the ass class for a Fighter to face, the Overlord! First up don't worry when they send 
their drones at you, you've got the speed to dodge them. If they send out their drones too far, you can charge in 
for the kill (in that case, it's a bad Overlord). Against better Overlords, start firing at their drones 
(acting as their shield) while keeping distance so that you have time to dodge them should the Overlord attack. 
If the Overlord has 0 reload, keep firing at it's drones and eventually their spawners won't be able to keep up with you. 
However, the most advanced technique to fight Overlords is... strafing. Yeah, you just attack the Overlord and 
if they send their drones out, you attack them with your side guns and push them back a bit. Keep repeating that 
(attack with the front cannon for more damage, but less time to react to their attacks), and if they choose to go 
defensive, just fire at their drones and try finding any openings that they leave and they're dead.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>5. Trappers</strong>
	<br>
Now Trappers are arguably the most durable classes in diep.io because of their traps being VERY powerful, 
but in cost of good attack (exceptions are Gunner Trapper and Auto Trapper). What you have to do is fire at 
the Trapper before they "create their wall of defense" (hopefully while none of their teammates are around), 
just keep your distance and fire at them, 2-3 bullets and they are dead. For Gunner Trapper, you have to be even 
more careful as they can aim (unlike Auto Trapper), but remember that their trap firing rate is slower, so use 
that to your advantage. Especially look out for their bullets as they are extremely powerful. Auto Trapper is 
fought just like the rest, just keep your eye on their auto gun and when it attacks you.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>6. Snipers</strong>
	<br>
Unlike you, Snipers fight from distance with fast bullets. What you need to do is use your speed to 
try getting closer to them, not very close but close enough so that you can charge at them and win. The 
only exception to that strategy being Predator. You can't charge at it carelessly as it's got 3 powerful bullets, 
enough to take you out easily. You need to pinpoint their location first (from where they fire), then get closer 
using your speed and fire at them while strafing to dodge their bullets.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>7. Destroyers</strong>
	<br>
In some cases, I'd rather fight an Overlord than Destroyer. Even to this day, Destroyers are 90% of 
my deaths as Fighter. Their speed, along with their 1 shot kill bullets makes them a very formidable foe. 
Keep in mind that they are the biggest threat to you, especially when you don't know where they are as they 
excel in ambush kills. To pinpoint a Destroyer's location, I spam left-click to shoot from my front turret 
without accelerating from my back turrets, and if they are close, they will fire their bullet. When you find 
out where they are, slowly approach them and try trapping them somewhere where they can't run easily (get between 
them and their base), then shoot at them while dodging their bullets. This is not easy, as their bullet outpenetrates 
all of yours, so you have to curve your bullets around theirs to even be able to hit them and keep your distance just 
enough so that you can dodge all of their bullets. 2-4 well placed bullets and they are dead.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>8. Tri-Angles</strong>
	<br>
Now if you're a skilled Fighter with let's say 600k score, naturally people will use the same tank 
as you to try taking you down. So first I'll cover up killing other glass Fighters. Treat an enemy glass Fighter 
like a bullet spammer and rammer at the same time, what I mean is keep your distance from it while not letting it 
get close to you. In most cases it's a game of dodging. So fire at the enemy while keeping your distance and dodge 
any of their bullets that could hit you. 2 well placed shots and they are dead. 
	<br>
	<br>
Now the more complicated enemies, dragon Fighters! The most important thing is to not let them get close to you, 
ALWAYS keep moving and don't stay in 1 place while firing bullets at them. What you need to do is attack it from 
the sides where it's vulnerable while avoiding the front part of it, and if you are about to get hit by it, retreat
a bit and keep firing at its sides. Despite most of the dragons having decent health/body damage, it doesn't take
much bullets from a Fighter to kill other tanks.
